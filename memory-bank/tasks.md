# Tasks

## Completed Tasks

- [x] [Level 1] Hide 'splited' status requests from EXECUTOR dashboard (Completed: 2025-01-27)
  - Task: Hide requests with 'splited' status from the recent requests list in ExecutorDashboard
  - Problem: EXECUTOR role was seeing original requests that had been split, which should be hidden
  - Solution: Added filtering logic to exclude requests with 'splited' status from the dashboard
  - Files modified:
    - `/home/zhandos/gp_latest/frontend/src/components/executor/ExecutorDashboard.tsx` - Added splited status filtering
  - Changes made:
    - Added filter to exclude requests with `r.status !== 'splited'` before applying other filters
    - Updated comment to clarify that all requests except splited are shown
    - Maintains existing filter functionality while hiding split original requests
  - Logic implemented:
    ```typescript
    // Hide requests with 'splited' status for EXECUTOR role
    filtered = filtered.filter(r => r.status !== 'splited');
    ```
  - Expected result:
    - EXECUTOR dashboard will not show original requests that have been split
    - Split requests (REQ-000XXX-01, REQ-000XXX-02) will still be visible if they have other statuses
    - All other filtering functionality remains unchanged
  - Frontend verification:
    - ✅ Frontend builds successfully
    - ✅ Splited status filtering added
    - ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] [Level 1] Fix SubRegistrarAssignmentsList import error (Completed: 2025-01-27)
  - Task: Fix "The requested module does not provide an export named 'SubRegistrarRequestsList'" error
  - Problem: AppRouter.tsx was trying to import SubRegistrarRequestsList as a named export, but there were issues with the export structure
  - Solution: Changed to use default export for better compatibility and reliability
  - Files modified:
    - `/home/zhandos/gp_latest/frontend/src/components/sub-registrar/SubRegistrarAssignmentsList.tsx` - Added default export
    - `/home/zhandos/gp_latest/frontend/src/components/App/AppRouter.tsx` - Updated import to use default export
  - Changes made:

- [x] [Level 2] Fix split request visibility for sub-registrars (Completed: 2025-01-27)
  - Task: Ensure each split request is only visible to its assigned sub-registrar
  - Problem: After splitting a request into multiple parts with different sub-registrars assigned to each part, all sub-registrars can see all split requests instead of only their assigned ones
  - Root cause: The get_requests endpoint for SUB_REGISTRAR role only filters by status (CLASSIFIED) but doesn't check SubRegistrarAssignment table
  - Solution implemented:
    1. ✅ Updated backend get_requests endpoint to join with SubRegistrarAssignment table
    2. ✅ Added filtering by current user's sub-registrar assignments

    - Original request visibility remains unchanged for other roles
  - Backend changes implemented:
    - ✅ Updated get_requests endpoint to join with SubRegistrarAssignment table
    - ✅ Added filtering by current user's sub-registrar assignments
    - ✅ Updated all SUB_REGISTRAR role filtering in statistics and dashboard functions
    - ✅ Updated expense articles filtering for sub-registrars
