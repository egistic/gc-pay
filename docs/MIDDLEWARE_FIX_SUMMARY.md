# Middleware Fix Summary

## Issue
The backend was throwing an `AttributeError` when trying to remove the "Server" header from response headers:

```
AttributeError: 'MutableHeaders' object has no attribute 'pop'
```

This error occurred in the security headers middleware at line 94 in `gc-spends-backend/app/main.py`.

## Root Cause
The `MutableHeaders` object in Starlette/FastAPI doesn't have a `pop()` method like regular Python dictionaries. The code was trying to use:

```python
response.headers.pop("Server", None)
```

## Solution
Replaced the `pop()` method with proper header deletion using the `in` operator and `del` statement:

```python
# Before (causing error)
response.headers.pop("Server", None)

# After (fixed)
if "Server" in response.headers:
    del response.headers["Server"]
```

## Files Modified
- `gc-spends-backend/app/main.py` - Fixed the security headers middleware

## Verification
The fix was tested and verified to work correctly:
- ✅ Server header is properly removed
- ✅ Security headers are added correctly
- ✅ No AttributeError is thrown
- ✅ Middleware executes successfully

## Impact
This fix resolves the 500 Internal Server Error that was occurring on all API requests, particularly CORS preflight requests (OPTIONS). The backend should now work properly with the Docker deployment.

## Testing
To verify the fix works in your environment:

1. Start the backend server
2. Make any API request (including CORS preflight)
3. Check that no `AttributeError` is thrown in the logs
4. Verify that security headers are present in responses
5. Confirm that the Server header is removed

The fix is minimal, safe, and maintains all the security functionality while resolving the compatibility issue with the `MutableHeaders` object.
